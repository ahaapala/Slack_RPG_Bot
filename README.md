# Slack_RPG_Bot
Slack bot that uses the ttrpg core code and provides a possible interface to use it to help run games

Status:
* Can connect to slack channels
* Recognizes commands
* Can invoke ttrpg library code

TODO:
* Plan out and implement bot interface 
* Adapt interface to library invocations
* Can probably improve on how to map bot command syntax
